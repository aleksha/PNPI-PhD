# Setup session

## Git

## Markdown
To prepare documentation for repositories it's preferable to use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). As author said, “Markdown” is two things:
  1. A plain text formatting syntax;
  2. A software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML.
We will use the first, as the second is already implemented all over the web. 

Lets follow github guide to see how easy Markdown formating is:

## LaTeX

## Probability distribution functions
Let's follow an introduction lecture by [Prof. Mark Thompson](https://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~thomson/lectures/lectures.html):

## Python3

In python3 a basic statistics is impemented into a standard library as a special module, which  provides functions for calculating statistics of data, including averages, variance, and standard deviation.

```python
import statistics as stat
help(stat) # press q to exit back into command line
```

More functionality is provided by special module entering [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. Here is a tutorial on **scipy.stats**:

## Homework

### Task

Create a documentaion about one of special probability density function (requested by a teacher).

### Expected outcome
  * Document in pdf-format containig proper information 
  * Link to a git repository (_github_, _gitlab_, _bitbucket_ or whatsoever), which contains a source code for figures in the report. Repository must contain a documentation on what is going on.
