## Markdown
To prepare documentation for repositories it's preferable to use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). As author said, “Markdown” is two things:
  1. A plain text formatting syntax;
  2. A software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML.
We will use the first, as the second is already implemented all over the web. 

Lets follow github guide to see how easy Markdown formating is:
